# Finals Lab Task 2 - Transforming ER Model to Relational
In this lab assignment, we were provided with a sample Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and asked to transform it into a relational database using MySQL. The task involved recognizing the relevant entities and their attributes to create a well-structured and functional database. Additionally, we had to define suitable primary and foreign keys to correctly establish the relationships between the tables.


In this activity, iâ€™ll show how to transform ER Model to Relational Tables using mySQL Workbench.
The following are the data attributes that we have to create inside a table:

## Table Structures
1. Student Table Structure
   
Meaning: One Student can have Many Submissions, Each Submission requires a valid Student.
